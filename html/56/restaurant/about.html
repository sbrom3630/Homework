            Established in 1954, Burger House has been a beloved cornerstone of our community for over six decades.
            Founded by George and Mary Thompson, the restaurant started as a small, family-run diner with a simple
            mission: to serve the best burgers in town with a smile. George's secret family recipes and Mary's warm
            hospitality quickly made Burger House a local favorite.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through the years, Burger House has stayed true to its roots while evolving to meet the tastes of new
            generations. Despite changes and expansions, the heart of Burger House remains the same—offering delicious,
            high-quality burgers made from locally-sourced ingredients. Today, the third generation of the Thompson
            family continues to uphold the traditions and values that have made Burger House a timeless classic.
        </p>

        <p>
            From the vintage photos on the walls to the nostalgic flavors in every bite, Burger House is more than just

        <p>
            George and Mary Thompson, the founders of Burger House, were both avid travelers who drew inspiration from
            their culinary adventures around the world. Before opening the restaurant, they embarked on a year-long road
            trip across America in a vintage Airstream trailer. During their journey, they visited countless diners and
            burger joints, collecting recipes and ideas that would later shape the iconic menu of Burger House. Their
            favorite discovery? A secret blend of spices from a small roadside diner in Texas, which became the
            signature seasoning for Burger House's famous patties!
